To get os.chdir() to access a network drive, I might have to manually map the drive.
Even if the drive is mapped, I might need to open it by clicking "Computer" or by typing its UNC path first.

I saved a version of the program will all of the user input pre-typed: see Google Drive "All About Me."

The pre-typed program refers to s:/2023 because it would only let me map s:/students.

For some reason, probably because I highlighted and copied quickly, the text file with usernames
contained some older students. I think I deleted all of them.
